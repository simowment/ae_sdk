# Beginner's Guide For Dropshipping

# **1.What Is Dropshipping?**

Dropshipping definition

Dropshipping is a business model where the seller doesn't keep the products in stock but instead transfers the customer orders and shipment details to the manufacturer, wholesaler, or another retailer who then ships the product directly to the customer. The dropshipper acts as a reseller, setting the prices and promoting the products, but doesn't handle the inventory or physical shipping of the products. This allows the dropshipper to save on inventory costs and focus on marketing and customer service.
